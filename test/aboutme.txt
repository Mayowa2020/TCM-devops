My Goals in the next 5years as a DevOps Engineer
As a DevOps engineer, I have a clear vision of my goals for the next five years. I want to enhance my skills and knowledge in cloud computing, especially in AWS, Azure and Google platforms. I plan to take all the necessary professional exams in these domains and obtain the relevant certifications. This will help me to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in DevOps and cloud engineering. I also hope to apply what I learn in real-world projects and contribute to the success of my organization and clients. By achieving these goals, I aim to become more competent and confident in my role as a DevOps engineer.
